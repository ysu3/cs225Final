Make sure you have ocaml 4.06.0, and ppx_deriving installed.

    > opam switch 4.06.0
    > opam install ppx_deriving

There are two special files in this directory which help merlin and ocamlbuild
know how to build the project.

First, there is a hidden file .merlin which instructs merlin to:
1. find source files in this directory
2. find build files in the _build directory
3. use the ppx_deriving.std package when checking files

Next, there is a special file _tags which instructs ocamlbuild to:
1. use the ppx_deriving.std package when compiling files

There is an included Makefile that will build all *.ml files in the current
directory as the default target:

    > make

If you want to execute a file, for example, hw3.ml, just execute:

    > make hw3

Running either of these commands will generate a bunch of compiled files. These
will get placed in the _build directory, and that directory will be created
automatically if it doesn't already exist. To get rid of the _build directory,
just execute:

    > make clean
